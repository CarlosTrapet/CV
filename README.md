## Carlos Trapet

Fullstack Web Development student at Makers Academy with a background in linguistics and a Master's Degree in Conference Interpreting.
Especially interested in Natural Language Processing and anything that would allow me to merge my two passions: coding and languages.
My ideal first Developer -experience would involve being part of a team where all knowledge is shared and I get to own, live and share my code. Building software that is meaningful and makes the users' lives easier is a truly unique experience.



#### Technical skills

I have always strived to find a career path that would force me to learn on a daily basis and never get repetitive. I deemed the task impossible until I discovered Software Development.
That very moment I started to teach myself how to code and immediately knew I wanted to be a part of that world.

My tasks at Careerjet, a specialized search engine, included web scraping of HTML, text extraction and processing with the use of Regular Expressions and scripting languages like Perl, as well as handling XML and CSS feeds.

#### Analytical skills 

My linguistics background enabled me to take an academic approach to learning software development as a first step, pairing it with the practical analysis and self critique typical in Conference Interpreting and the attention to detail required in legal and scientific translation.

My proudest achievements include:
- Deciding to learn the basics of Node.js, Express and MongoDB to build a basic app that lets the user post and interact with the database (in 3 days!)
- Interpreting for the Spanish booth at the European Parliament during the Model European Union event
- Conquering 3 of the highest peaks at the North Pole and managing to finish the Arctic Challenge!
